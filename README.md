# Node Express Handlebars

## Description 
This simple application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM to query and route data in the app and generate HTML. A burger name is added by the user and then displayed in the 'Your Order' column. The user then has an option to either delete the burger or 'Devour It!'. If the user wants to delete the item, they can click on the 'X' and if they are happy with their burger choice, they can devour it. In this case, the burger name is moved to another column labeled 'In Your Stomach'.
